<p class="p3">Jim McCarten, a partner with Burr &amp; Forman LLP, works out of both the firm’s Atlanta and Nashville offices. A “traditional tax practitioner” for the first 25 years of his professional career, Jim’s immersion in special needs planning began when his youngest daughter was diagnosed with autism. Since then, his work with families who have a loved one dealing with one or more disabilities has steadily increased to the point where special needs planning has become a regular part of his day-to-day practice. A regular speaker to financial professionals, CPAs, Bar organizations and/or family organizations on substantive tax matters as well as special needs planning, including guardianship, conservatorship, transition and housing issues, Jim is a Fellow in the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel and a member of the Special Needs Alliance. He has also been regularly included in various <i>Super Lawyers</i> lists and <i>Best Lawyers in America</i> in the areas of Estates and Trusts, Nonprofit/Charity Law, Tax Law and Tax Controversy-Litigation. A graduate of the University of Kansas with a degree in Accounting, the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law and Emory University with an LLM (Taxation), Jim, his wife, Diane, and their daughter, Kathryn, now live in Fayette County, Georgia along with their personal kennel. Both Jim and Diane are active with The Arc of Georgia, Fayetteville First United Methodist Church and other Fayette County disability advocacy and community organizations.</p>
